Algorithm


1. Start-Up
Step1: Initialize the application.
Step2: Browse the video locally.
Step3: Open video in picture box.
Step4: Apply motion detection.
Step5: If (applied) Goto Pre-processing

2. Pre-Processing
Step1: Apply number of patches specified 
Step2: Store the images in the database 
Step3: select the patch for object detection


3. Object Recognition 
Step1: Perform object recognition using Convolutional neural network.
Step2: Show recognized object name from label.txt.
Step3: Send the data to next step.
Step4: Stop.

4. Obstacle Warning.
Step1: Receive the labels 
Step2: if (object detected = obstacle) Go to: Step3 else Go to: step4
Step3: Display “warning as stop” to end-user 
Step4: Display “safe to move”
